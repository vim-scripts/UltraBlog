The biggest difference between UltraBlog.vim and other Vim blogging scripts is that UltraBlog.vim supplies two modes: the first one is editor mode, in which users can manage posts and pages in their blogs, just like other Vim blogging scripts; the second is client mode, in which posts and pages are stored in a local SQLite database, in this way, it does not only OPERATE on posts/pages in blogs but also MANAGE them locally. So UltraBlog.vim is an integrated blogging client more than just a blog editor.

You will find UltraBlog.vim very useful when you write posts in some light weight markup languages, such as Markdown, LaTeX, reStructuredText and Textile. With posts/pages stored locally, you can edit them in any light weight markup language at any time even after a long time when they were published, and update the online copies in HTML syntax. 

This is the exact original intention for which I wrote UltraBlog.vim. After years of blogging, I've formed the habbit that writing posts in Markdown syntax to save time, and I think it is good to always keep my posts updated, rather than post it and forget it. But I found it hard to update the posted copies after modifying the local Markdown source files with other Vim blogging plugins. 

Though it is packaged as a vimball and with a filename as UltraBlog.vba, I prefer UltraBlog.vim as the plugins name for that .vim looks very hacker.

Here is a post written in Chinese describing the motion for which I wrote UltraBlog.vim:
